# Blockchain Playground

Blockchain and cryptocurrency with educational playground to be added soon.

## Brief Description

This project started as a basic blockchain [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/build-blockchain/) course in Mid 2018. It's final purpose is to have React-based frontend, showing exactly how blockchain, mining and transactions work in real time via interactive playground. **But not yet**. Because I currently have other important projects to finish, this one has to wait, **probably until October 2018**.
